## The Shell
A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.
In essence, a shell is a program that takes user commands from the command line via the terminal, and gives them to the operating system to execute.
##About this Project
This project is a simple version of the linux shell, as part of the requirementsof the ALX Software Engineering Program's low level programming.
The predominant programming Language used is C. 
The simple shell should have the basic functionality of a normal shell.
