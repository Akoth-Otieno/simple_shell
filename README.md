## The Shell
A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.
In essence, a shell is a program that takes user commands from the command line via the terminal, and gives them to the operating system to execute.
## About This Project
* This project is a simple version of the linux shell, as part of the requirements of the ALX Africa software engineering program's low level programming.
* The predominant programming Language used is **C**. 
* The simple shell should have the basic functionality of a normal shell.
## Functionality of the Simple Shell:
* Displays a prompt and waits for user input.
* Runs all commands of type "executable program".
* Runs the built_in commands **exit**, **env**, **setenv** and **unsetenv**.
* Handles commands with arguments.
* Handles the PATH global variable.
* Handles the EOF (End Of File) condition.
* Handles the Ctrl + C signal, meaning it terminates a process without exiting the shell.
